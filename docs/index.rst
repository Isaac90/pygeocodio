Welcome to pygeocodio's documentation!
======================================

Python wrapper for `Geocod.io geocoding API <http://geocod.io/docs/>`_.

Features
========

* Geocode an individual address
* Batch geocode up to 10,000 addresses at a time
* Parse an address into its identifiable components

Read the complete `Geocod.io documentation <http://geocod.io/docs/>`_ for
service documentation.

Installation
============

pygeocodio requires `requests` 2.0.0 or greater and will ensure requests is
installed::

    pip install pygeocodio

Basic usage
===========

Import the API client and ensure you have a valid API key::

    >>> from geocodio import GeocodioClient
    >>> client = GeocodioClient(MY_KEY)
    >>> geocoded_location = client.geocode("42370 Bob Hope Drive, Rancho Mirage CA")

The result from the Geocod.io service is a dictionary including your query, its
components, and a list of matching results::

    >>> geocoded_location
    {
      "input": {
        "address_components": {
          "number": "42370",
          "street": "Bob Hope",
          "suffix": "Dr",
          "city": "Rancho Mirage",
          "state": "CA"
        },
        "formatted_address": "42370 Bob Hope Dr, Rancho Mirage CA"
      },
      "results": [
        {
          "address_components": {
            "number": "42370",
            "street": "Bob Hope",
            "suffix": "Dr",
            "city": "Rancho Mirage",
            "state": "CA",
            "zip": "92270"
          },
          "formatted_address": "42370 Bob Hope Dr, Rancho Mirage CA, 92270",
          "location": {
            "lat": 33.738987255507,
            "lng": -116.40833849559
          },
          "accuracy": 1
        },
        {
          "address_components": {
            "number": "42370",
            "street": "Bob Hope",
            "suffix": "Dr",
            "city": "Rancho Mirage",
            "state": "CA",
            "zip": "92270"
          },
          "formatted_address": "42370 Bob Hope Dr, Rancho Mirage CA, 92270",
          "location": {
            "lat": 33.738980796909,
            "lng": -116.40833917329
          },
          "accuracy": 0.8
        }
      ]
    }

This returned several geolocation results in descending order of accuracy, so
the first and most accurate geocoded location latitude and longitude can be
accessed using the `coords` attribute::

    >>> geocoded_location.coords
    (-116.40833849559, 33.738987255507)

.. note::

    To make working with `other geographic data
    <http://postgis.net/docs/ST_Point.html>`_ formats easier the `coords`
    method returns a tuple in (longitude, latitude) format.

Batch geocoding
===============

You can also geocode a list of addresses::

    >>> geocoded_addresses = geocodio.geocode(['1600 Pennsylvania Ave, Washington, DC',
            '3101 Patterson Ave, Richmond, VA, 23221'])

Return just the coordinates for the list of geocoded addresses::

    >>> geocoded_addresses.coords
    [(-116.40833849559, 33.738987255507), (-116.40833849559, 33.738987255507)]

Lookup an address by formatted address::

    >>> geocoded_addresses.addresses.get['1600 Pennsylvania Ave, Washington, DC'].coords
    (-116.40833849559, 33.738987255507)

Note that to perform the key based lookup you must use the `get` method. This
preserves the list's index based lookup.

.. note::

    If one address cannot be parsed or geocoded the Geocod.io service will
    still respond, but the `response` value for that address will be an error
    message. E.g. if a query was an emptry string, the value for that
    particular query would look like this::

        {
            "query": "",
            "response": {
                "error": "Could not parse address"
            }
        }

    In this case the a lookup for `""` would yield `None`. The `None` value is
    not removed from the list in the `LocationCollection` because then the
    indices in the response addresses would no longer match the indices in the
    request addresses.

Address component parsing
=========================

And if you just want to parse an individual address into its components::

    >>> client.parse('1600 Pennsylvania Ave, Washington DC')
    {
        "address_components": {
            "number": "1600",
            "street": "Pennsylvania",
            "suffix": "Ave",
            "city": "Washington",
            "state": "DC"
        },
        "formatted_address": "1600 Pennsylvania Ave, Washington DC"
    }

The return value is simple enough to us as the returned dictionary.

Exceptions
==========

The Geocod.io service may respond with errors, so `pygeocodio` provides some
names exceptions that can be used to identify specific error types. The
Geocod.io documentation lists the following expected responses::

    200 OK Hopefully you will see this most of the time. Note that this status code will also be returned even though no geocoding results were available
    403 Forbidden Invalid API key or other reason why access is forbidden
    422 Unprocessable Entity A client error prevented the request from executing succesfully (e.g. invalid address provided). A JSON object will be returned with an error key containing a full error message
    500 Server Error Hopefully you will never see this...it means that something went wrong in our end. Whoops.

To handle these:

* An HTTP 403 error raises a `GeocodioAuthError`
* An HTTP 422 error raises a `GeocodioDataError` and the error message will be
  reported through the exception
* An HTTP 5xx error raises a `GeocodioServerError`
* An unmatched non-200 response will simply raise `GeocodioError`
